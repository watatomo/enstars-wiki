## Removing Shadows from SS Sprites

While this is optional, it's my personal preference to remove shadows from the sprites. The colors for them are quite inconsistent anyways.

1. Load up your desired file onto AssetStudio
2. Navigate to the file's `Asset List` and export the texture for the sprite (named `base`)

  - I personally place the files in a folder so it's more organized, like so

3. Open Photoshop and erase the shadow. It's always in the same spot
